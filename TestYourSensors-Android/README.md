2. Gyroscope sensor - gyroscope sensor reports the rate of rotation of the device around the 3 sensor axes;
3. Proximity sensor - proximity sensor reports the distance from the sensor to the closest visible surface;
4. Orientation sensor - orientation sensor reports the attitude of the device. The measurements are reported in degrees in the x, y and z fields;
5. Barometer sensor - pressure sensor (also known as barometer) reports the atmospheric pressure in hectopascal (hPa);
6. Lights sensor - light sensor reports the current illumination in SI lux units;
7. Magnetic sensor - magnetic field sensor (also known as magnetometer) reports the ambient magnetic field, as measured along the 3 sensor axes.
