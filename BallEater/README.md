# BallEater
My personal android game.
Description:
 I have a box which I can move upward any time I touch the screen and go backward when I release the touchscreen. It has conditions for establishing the number of points accumulated each time you get a ball in the box and a condition for ending the game (when you touch the bomb).
 
 # How to play:
 Any time you touch the screen the box will move upward. You get points for touching
