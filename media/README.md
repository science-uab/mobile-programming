When we launch the application on our mobile phone, it will show us:

- On the top of the clock with the exact time
-  Below the bottom-right, left, right, and mobile phone's speed sensor
-  an image that disappears at the moment of touch
- at the bottom of the page a video is uploaded from the net from an address
The java file contains functions for the sensors used in the program
