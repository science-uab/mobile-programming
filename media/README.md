 The project contains the following files:
 
1.  README PROIECT MEDIA.md` is the file you're reading.  You should be reading it on GitHub.
2.   2.JPG is the the picture file they use.
3.   media.html` media.html is the executable file
4.    media.js is the javascript file
When we launch the application on our mobile phone, it will show us:

- On the top of the clock with the exact time
-  Below the bottom-right, left, right, and mobile phone's speed sensor
-  an image that disappears at the moment of touch
- at the bottom of the page a video is uploaded from the net from an address
The java file contains functions for the sensors used in the program
