  - Created to be used in constructions, but can be used in other domains.
  - Android application created with Processing for Android.
  - The source code is exported as .apk from Processing IDE.
  - The generated apk is instaled on the device.

## How to use:
  - The home page contains eight buttons, with different actions:
    
###  1. Color picker:
  - In this page you can get the realtime color of any object, using device's camera.

###  2. Sound intensity:
  - You can get the sound intensity from suroundings, by parsing the sound amplitude received through microphone to dB;

### 3. Location:
  - You get the GPS coordonatied (altitude, longitude, latitude)
    
### 4. Distanta:
- You can calculate the absolute distance between two points in space, using GPS.
   
### 5. Inclination:
  - You can get area inclination, using accelerometer sensor.
    
### 6. Bubble level
  - It simulates the bubble level, using accelerometer sensor.
   
###  7. Unit converter
  - In this page you can convert any type of units, by example: temperature, distance, volume.
   
###  8. Calculate perimeter, area and volume
   - For 2d and 3d figures.
   - Depending of what you chose, it will show a list with figures. After selecting a figure, it will show the figure drawing, inputs         to add values and the final result, that is perimeter and area, or area and volume.(depending by figure type)
