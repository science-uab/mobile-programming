How to use:
The moment in which we launch the application of the mobile phone application,
- In the top (left corridor) date and time, which updates automatically.
- A four-column table.
A. In the first column, you upload a video from a network address. The movie can be watched (turned on, turned off, downloaded) and the volume can be adjusted.
b. In the second column, the application uses the sensors to fin the coordinates of the phone.
c. In a third column, the form allows the user to enter feedback about the application to help in improving it.
d. In the fourth column of the application, it uses the phoneâ€™s visual sensors, automatically turning on the camera, and with a touch, you can get the image which can further be downloaded on your phone.
- At the bottom of the page, there is  data about location (longitude, latitude) and geographic map due to sensors at the user's disposal.
- The application allows the playback of the words spoken by the user, while vibrating.
The files contains the functions for the sensors in program.
Sensor explanation:
The image sensor is a sensor that detects and converts the information constituting an image by transforming the variable attenuation of light (as it passes through or is reflected from objects) into a signal. 
A microphone is a translator that converts the sound into an electrical signal.
The touch screen is an input-output device usually attached above an electronic visual display of an information processing system. A user can enter or control the system information by touching or multiple touches with a special device or one or more fingers. The user can customize the display: increase or decrease the resolution and change the size of the text. The device can also react physically to touch: it can produce vibrations, sounds, start or stop components.
Geolocation is the identification or estimation of  the real geographic location of an object (telephone, computer, TV, etc.). For geolocation or positioning, the search engine uses radio frequencies locating methods. Geolocation can also be done through the GPS coordinates of the device. Geolocation can show latitude, longitude or altitude.
